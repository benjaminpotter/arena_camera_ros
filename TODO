had to reset to commit 4b2b681 because build failed on newer commits
https://github.com/benjaminpotter/arena_camera_ros/commit/4b2b6812d0c273ff606e9404d23344bf293a00c9
i think commit 63257d1 caused the problem

created new branch bp-polarization-support
this will serve as the root for my changes
it is branched from the last "release" commit that works (4b2b...)

have to track down this fricking bug because the original driver was written by
a literal four year old. right now a random std::runtime_error is getting thrown
the only place in the codebase where std::runtime_error is thrown is in a file
called inc/image_encodings.h which you have to manually copy into the ros source
everytime you edit it. when i edit it and add it to the ros source it doesn't 
appear like my changes are taking effect.

found the solution. the gen2Ros function needs to return the mono8 string rather
than the polarize_mono8 string. i think this has to do with the way the images
are actually displayed. openCV can only parse the image if it knows the encoding
the polarize_mono8 image from the camera is essentially just mono8 encoding with
semantic differences in pixel values (intensity of light through the micro
polarization array).

(1) add new encoding to image_encodings.h (POLARIZE_MONO8)
(2) handle new encoding in encoding_conversions.cpp 
(3) bag the data

NOTES
genAPI encoding string must match the returned string by GetNodeMap "PixelFormat"

GenAPI string = "PolarizeMono8"
RosAPI string = "polarize_mono8" and "mono8"
RosAPI handle = image_encodings::POLARIZE_MONO8
